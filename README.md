# multiverse-tutorial
This tutorial is based on the article [Pipal, C., Song, H., and Boomgaarden. H. (2022) "If you have all the choices, why not choose (and share) all of them?]. We hope that interested researchers can easly get started with doing a multiverse analysis in R using this ressource. 

This tutorial will be updated continously to create a learning and teaching resource on multiverse analysis.
